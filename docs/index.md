## About AndyWebServices El El Sí

AndyWebServices (AWS) is a proudly independent, questionably stable cloud platform offering bare bones "cloud"
services that kind of work if you don't look too closely. Whether you are personally friends with the CEO or not,
AndyWebServices is your one-stop shop for all the web services you need[^1]!

Offering everything from elastic compute (up to 4 Raspberry Pis, after I'm done using them) to A1 models
that will make people obsolete (trust me bro), AndyWebServices is your one-stop shop for all things "cloud".
With data centers reportedly scattered across at least two regions and a vague commitment to reliability, we enable
innovation with the confidence of Stockton Rush.

Boasting a bold 1 seven of uptime (that’s 70%[^2]), our growing list of services includes AndyCompute™[^3] ,
AndyStorage™[^3], and our original AndyA1™ — our unique artificial intelligence recipe that can add blue smoke to any
project!

AndyWebServices — Cloud Done the Andy Way™
